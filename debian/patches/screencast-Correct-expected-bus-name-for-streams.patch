Subject: screencast: Correct expected bus name for streams
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Previously, this only worked because GDBusConnection was not filtering
signals by their sender correctly (GNOME/glib#3268).

Thanks: Alicia Boya García
